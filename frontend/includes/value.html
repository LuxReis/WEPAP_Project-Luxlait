            OUR VALUES
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>At Luxlait, our priority for more than 125 years has been to develop high quality products while respecting
            our
            environment and the people who provide us with this exceptional raw material. In order to best meet the
            growing
            expectations of our consumers, we have decided to redefine our values and share them with you:</p>

                <h5>Premium Quality</h5>
                <h2>TOP QUALITY DAIRY PRODUCTS TO PLEASE THE WHOLE FAMILY... ALL OVER THE WORLD.</h2>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>The satisfaction of its customers being at the centre of its concerns, Luxlait makes every effort
                        to offer
                        a wide range of high quality and ethically irreproachable products.<br>
                        The milk, of Luxembourg origin, is collected by Luxlait tankers from human-scale farms and then
                        transported
                        to the dairy where it will be processed into exceptional products. Controlling all stages of the
                        production
                        chain allows Luxlait to guarantee its consumers flawless traceability.<br>
                        Nearly 1,500 analyses per day are carried out in its in-house laboratory and Luxlait meets the
                        most stringent
                        international requirements of the agri-food industry, which has earned it IFS Food, BIO, halal
                        and kosher
                        certification.<br>
                        The cooperative is part of a continuous improvement process. Being good is no longer enough, we
                        strive to be
                        the best.

                            Luxlait is owned by its associated farmers that act also as suppliers and customers.<br>
                            Its organisation is based on fairness and solidarity, which are strong values among our
                            dairy producers.<br>
                            All the income generated by Luxlait, is redistributed to the members of the cooperative.
                            This way Luxlait is continuously guaranteeing the future of its farmers, their families
                            and farms for decades.

                        <p>Respect for the environment is an integral part of our corporate values.<br>
                            The central location of its production unit as close as possible to its cooperative
                            producers allows Luxlait to guarantee collection and distribution channels that are among
                            the shortest in the world and, by extension, the freshness of its raw materials as well as a
                            limited impact on the environment.<br>
                            In terms of packaging, Luxlait pays close attention to the latest innovations in terms of
                            packaging with a lower carbon footprint and already uses certified FSC and BIO-based
                            solutions.<br>
                            With regard to waste treatment, Luxlait has set up an efficient sorting and recycling
                            system.<br>
                            Its own purification plant allows Luxlait to treat wastewater before it is returned to the
                            environment. The cooperative uses catchment water and equipment with reduced energy

                                As a pillar of Luxembourg agriculture, the Luxlait agricultural cooperative needs to
                                think and act in a sustainable way, i.e. base its economic development on the protection
                                of the environment and equitable social development. Aware of the growing expectations
                                of consumers, in 2009 Luxlait started building one of the most modern production
                                facilities in Europe, with continuous improvement as a guiding principle.<br>
                                With its highly qualified staff, permanent technology watch and numerous investments,
                                the traditional Luxembourg business prides itself on producing in a sustainable manner,
                                in compliance with the hygiene and quality standards of the agri-food industry.
